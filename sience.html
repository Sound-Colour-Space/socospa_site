			<p>By investigating the conceptual field of sound, tone, pitch, and timbre in its relation 
			to visual phenomena and geometrical concepts, the project <em>Sound Colour Space - 
			A Virtual Museum</em> contributes to an interdisciplinary field of research and aims to explore 
			its adequate modes of representation and communication.<br />
			<br />
			Many scientists and philosophers from antiquity to modern times have studied the relationships 
			between sound, light and geometry. Many of their visualisations of acoustical, optical and 
			perceptual topics speak to the eye and can be studied comparatively. These pictures are 
			interesting because of their diagrammatic structure, in the way they combine text, images 
			and spatial structures on a flat surface and in the way they address topological, philosophical 
			and psychological questions. They often have an aesthetic value of their own. The interdependencies 
			between sound and light, physics and perception seen through the spectacles of geometry, 
			i.e., by using mathematics as a kind of universal meta-language, is a topos of the history 
			of science and philosophy that can be traced back to Greek antiquity (Pythagoras, Aristoxenos, 
			Aristotle and Euclid) and figures in recent discourses in philosophy and aesthetics as well. <br /> 
			<br />
			The collection and study of these materials and the attempts to present them as a sequential text 
			lead to the question of adequate forms of representation. Since a given picture or graphic can 
			appear in various contexts and with different implications, a distinct network architecture 
			permits forms of content representation free of redundancies in a way that is difficult to 
			achieve in textual form. Accordingly, we will analyse our collection of scientific illustrations 
			and diagrams (currently about 1000 image files) and present them together with related materials 
			and findings within an open, dynamical online publication. The metaphor «museum» is thus rendered 
			as a place where people and objects meet and interact in various dynamic modes. Visitors will gain 
			access to the collection of pictures and will be able to compare and regroup the pictures, 
			read explanations, listen to sound examples, watch animations and interact with audio-visual 
			applications, or just follow guided tours. Scientists and scholars will use the museum as a 
			research tool and add to the contents of the underlying database. The planned application 
			will be based on the Media Archive of the Arts developed at the ZHdK and will contribute 
			to the further development of this online platform as a research tool. <br /> 
			<br />
			The structure of scientific knowledge in general and the topics of our project in particular 
			can be captured by relational models as used in computer science. Object-oriented and 
			relational data modelling offer means of interpreting «the world» in ways that exceed 
			classical sequential and hierarchical organisations of knowledge by highlighting 
			relational and dynamical aspects of objects and processes under consideration. 
			These ways of organising and representing knowledge had precursors in the early 
			seventeenth century. Robert Fludd’s Temple of Music (1618) is a kind of virtual museum. 
			Fludd uses the temple’s architecture as a metaphor for science where all topics related 
			to music have a place in space. In the treatise’s main section, the different parts of 
			the temple are fully developed and «curated» – sometimes by adding extra pictures, 
			sometimes by using «tree sentences» and sometimes in ordinary Latin language. 
			This creates a network of science (see Fig. 1, 2).
